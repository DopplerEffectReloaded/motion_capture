# motion_capture
### This is a work in progress repository

This repository contains object tracking, facial tracking functionality using opencv. It tracks and classifies faces using haar-cascade classifiers, background subtraction methods and optical flow tracking.

In the future I plan to make this into a complete application in which the system will track the users exercises and tell them where they can improve. This will be done using the movenet API in tensorflow.js
